# C3 Language

C3 is a C-like language trying to be "an incremental improvement over C" rather than a whole new language. 
C3 owes a lot to the ideas of the [C2 language](http://c2lang.org): to iterate on top of C without trying to be a 
whole new language.

C3 tries to be an alternative in the the C/C++ niche: fast and close to the metal.

### Design Principles
- Procedural "get things done"-type of language.
- Try to stay close to C - only change where truly needed.
- C ABI compatibility and excellent C integration.
- Learning C3 should be easy for a C programmer.
- Data is inert.
- Avoid "big ideas" & the "more is better" fallacy.
- Introduce some higher level conveniences where the value is great.

### Example code

```c++
module hello_world;
import std::io;

func void main()
{
   io::printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
```

### In what ways do C3 differ from C?

- No mandatory header files
- New semantic macro system
- Generic modules
- Module based
- Subarrays (slices) and vararrays built in
- Compile time reflection
- Enhanced compile time execution
- "Result" based zero overhead error handling
- Defer
- Value methods
- Associated enum data
- Built in strings
- No preprocessor
- Undefined behaviour trapped on debug by default
- Optional pre and post conditions

### Current status

It's possible to try out the current C3 compiler in the browser: https://ide.judge0.com/?1EFo â€“ this is courtesy of the
developer of Judge0. 

Design work is still being done in the design draft here: https://c3lang.github.io/c3docs/. If you have any suggestions, send a mail to [christoffer@aegik.com](mailto:christoffer@aegik.com), [file an issue] (https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/issues) or discuss 
C3 on its dedicated Discord: https://discord.gg/qN76R87
you are also welcome to discuss in the C3 channel on 
the r/ProgrammingLanguages Discord: https://discord.gg/cfu4wdk

#### What can you help with?

- If you wish to contribute with ideas, please file issues on the c3docs: https://github.com/c3lang/c3docs instead of the compiler.
- Discuss the language on discord to help iron out syntax.
- Stdlib work will soon start, do you want to help out building the C3 std lib?
- Do you want to do real compiler work? Everyone is welcome to contribute.
