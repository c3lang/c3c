The automatically generated patch puts this free form text on top of it.

If you are using gbp-buildpackage(1), you probably don't need this file.

If you are using dgit-maint-merge(7), please consider text as follows.

The Debian packaging of foo is maintained in git, using the merging workflow
described in dgit-maint-merge(7).  There isn't a patch queue that can be
represented as a quilt series.

A detailed breakdown of the changes is available from their canonical
representation - git commits in the packaging repository.  For example, to see
the changes made by the Debian maintainer in the first upload of upstream
version 1.2.3, you could use:

    % git clone https://git.dgit.debian.org/foo
    % cd foo
    % git log --oneline 1.2.3..debian/1.2.3-1 -- . ':!debian'

(If you have dgit, use `dgit clone foo`, rather than plain `git clone`.)

A single combined diff, containing all the changes, follows.
