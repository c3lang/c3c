# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a good experience for everyone, no exceptions.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accept and give constructive criticism
* Treat others as you want to be treated

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments and personal attacks
* Harassment of any kind
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting
* Bringing up politics of any kind (see below!)

#### Politics
Due to the volatile nature of political discussions, and the potential danger
in disrupting the community's efforts, discussion on politics is banned from 
this project. This includes, but is not limited to, politicized arguments,
talking about the political affiliation of members and pushing changes to the
project for political reasons. Community members should feel free to hold any
political views from left to right, and that they are treated equal regardless
of political view. Members are free and encouraged to engage in political 
activities outside of this project.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at info@c3-lang.org. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
